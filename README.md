# Kenn Kitchen
I'm a full-stack LA/EMP expert, and a web nerd on pretty much every level. I like making websites (design and content), coding in PHP (but not JavaScript, sorry!), cloud architecture... all the browser-based things.

When one says LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) or LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) the fact that we're talking server-side/backend should be pretty obvious, but yeah, I'm about that part of it. But I don't just think that there are parts of it to love and parts just to make do with, I think all the parts are fun.

Lest ye think that I'm some kind of old-school-only nerd, all of those ReactJS/VueJS/Angular front-ends need to call APIs and I love microservices. (Even in NodeJS if push comes to shove! 😁) Also, MongoDB starts with an "M" and I'm really into automating things (i.e. Ansible, BASH) so that backend things just work without a lot of extra hands-on.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on ~~a secret plan to take over the universe and install Linux on it~~ fleshing out the service we offer at [webinology.io](https://webinology.io) (where, if you're a web developer, we can be the "ops" to your "dev");
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about Ansible (I can never get enough) and CI/CD across different platforms;
